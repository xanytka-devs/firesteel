Firesteel v.0.2.1.0
- Replaced Assimp with TinyOBJLoader, TinyGLTF, UFBX.
- Node-based rendering.
- Utilities class was reformatted and now much simpler to use.
- New system dialog provider - "simple-file-dialogs".
- Better logging: `LOGF(...)` provides formatted output, works pretty much as `printf(...)`, but better.
- Some optimizations (not documented as which).
- Default fail-safe shader.
- `Renderer` now acts like an interface. It can be built upon like the `App` class. There's still OpenGL code thrown all around the engine (prominently in base rendering classes (`Mesh`, `Shader`, etc.))
- Simpler CMake builder - `auto_cmake.bat`.
- NVTX3 support.
- Updated documentation.
- Build support for 86x (not tested).
